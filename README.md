- 👋 Hi, I’m @Jav0918 - I'll keep this page short since I'm relatively new to the world of software and coding. This will be my repository for all things computer science related. Any and all feedback is appreciated.
- 👀 I’m interested in all things tech ! Well maybe most things.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning SQL, JAVA, PYTHON, C++ and working on my BS in Computer Science at WGU.

- 📫 How to reach me....for now, lets keep this blank.
